# Run run.py file to create the grid extract.
# make sure to update the original sdb-grid path
# Use input_ini.py file to change the necessary parameters
# I have already run the grid_extract from the main sdb-grid.
# presented for future refrences, in case if we need to update the grid extract with a new parameter.
# modify this grid_extract.py to do so.
# change the input paramters for the run.
# Could use the hyper threading True in input_ini.py file
# Adjust the threading size based on memory and disk space
# default threading 10 => requires 200+ GB temporary space ; 20 ==> 400+ GB
# the necessary files will be extracted to sdb_grid folder inside the program directory.
# a csv file with all the additional paramters from the model is created in the program directory under name sdbgrid_extract.csv
